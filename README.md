Hello.I created my framework as a maven project in BDD style by utilizing Cucumber and Selenium WedDriver. I followed POM (Page Object Model) and Singelton design pattern. All my dependencies in the pom.xml file.In order to be able to run the project you need to have Java 1.8 and Maven automation tool. You can manage brawser type from configuration.properties file. You also can read and see all bugs by reading logger messages. As a suggestion I would recommend you to specify a time zone, to make sure the program works well in any time zone. Make the calculation correct, and the important thing is to put some boundaries on input boxes for APR and credit limits as well. I believe 10000000000000 credit limit or percentage should not be opened. Please see cucumber report!! Sorry I had a very limited time to work on this assignment, so it is not polished, but it was a pleasure to work on it, thank you for the opportunity.
