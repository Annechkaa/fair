Hello.I created my framework as a maven project in BDD style by utilizing Cucumber and Selenium WedDriver. I followed POM (Page Object Model) and SingeltonÂ design pattern. All my dependencies in the pom.xml file.In order to be able to run the project you need to have Java 1.8 and Maven automation tool. You can manage brawser type from configuration.properties file. You also can read and see all bugs by reading logger messages.
